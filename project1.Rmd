## Stories from the Atlas: Describing Data using Maps, Regressions, and Correlations {-}

- **Posted**: Wednesday, August 28, 2024

- **Part 1**: Due at midnight on Tuesday , September 11, 2024

- **Part 2**: Due at midnight on Tuesday , September 17, 2024

The [Opportunity Atlas](https://www.opportunityatlas.org/) is a freely available interactive mapping tool that traces the roots of outcomes such as poverty and incarceration back to the neighborhoods in which children grew up. Once you are on the main landing page, select **Module 1 (Neighborhoods - MOBILITY OUTCOMES)**.  

Policymakers, journalists, and the public have begun to explore the Opportunity Atlas, casting  new light on the geography of upward mobility in communities across the country.  As an example, see Jasmine Garsd’s [analysis](https://www.npr.org/2018/10/04/654085265/the-american-dream-one-block-can-make-all-the-difference) for the New York City neighborhood of Brownsville in Brooklyn.

In this first empirical project, you will use the Opportunity Atlas mapping tool and the underlying data to describe equality of opportunity in your hometown and across the United States. (If you grew up outside the United States, you may select a community in which you have spent some time, such as San Antonio, TX.)  

The end product will be a short narrative (or story) in which you describe what you have learned from the Atlas, in which you will weave in the narrative along with the data analysis. Below is a list of specific analyses and questions that your narrative must address. The document should contain references, graphs, and maps. 

This project focuses on the following methods for descriptive data analysis.  (The later empirical projects you will do in this class will be focused on causal inference and prediction).  

1.	Data visualization.  Maps are a powerful way to present descriptive statistics for data with a geographic component.  You will use maps to display upward mobility statistics for the Census tracts in your hometown.

2.	Regression and correlation analysis. You will use linear regressions and correlation coefficients to quantify the statistical relationship between upward mobility and potential explanatory variables.

The R data file that you will use in this assignment, `atlas.rds`, contains an extract of the Opportunity Atlas data. It is also merged on several other variables, which you may use for the correlational analysis.  

You can load the data by using the usual line:

```{r eval=FALSE}
atlas <- readRDS(gzcon(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jrm87/ECO3253_fall2023/master/data/atlas.rds")))
```

## Instructions {-}

You will work on RStudio through Posit Cloud for this project. Write the narrative within a Quarto file in the **project1** tab in Posit Cloud, and upload the final pdf document to Canvas. 

The deliverables for Part 1 and Part 2 are the following: 

1.	**Part 1**: points 1 to 5 
2.	**Part 2**: points 1 to 10 - this should include any feedback you received for Part 1

> Notice that Part 2 includes Part 1

I created a Section to help you get up to speed with [Quarto/RMarkdown here](#rmarkdown). The Quarto/RMarkdown file is where you will write your narrative, run all your analysis, and the output of each code block should be visible. The output should include references, graphs, maps, and tables. 

### Specific questions to address in your narrative {-}

1.	Start by looking up the city where you grew up on the [Opportunity Atlas](https://www.opportunityatlas.org/). Zoom in to the Census tracts around your home.  
Figure 1 in your narrative should be a map of the Census tracts in your hometown from the Opportunity Atlas.  Examples for Milwaukee, WI (where Professor Chetty grew up) and Los Angeles, CA (discussed in Lecture 1) are shown on the next page.  The text of your narrative should describe what you see, and what data are being visualized.  

Examine the patterns for a number of different groups (e.g., lowest income children, high income children) and outcomes (e.g., earnings in adulthood, incarceration rates).  Only choose one or two of these to include in your narrative.  

2.	(To answer this question, read the [Opportunity Atlas manuscript](https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/atlas_paper.pdf)) What period do the data you are analyzing come from?  Are you concerned that the neighborhoods you are studying may have changed for kids now growing up there?  What evidence do Chetty et al. (2018) provide suggesting that such changes are or are not important?  What type of data could you use to test whether your neighborhood has changed in recent years?

3.	Now turn to the `atlas.rds` data set.  How does average upward mobility, pooling races and genders, for children with parents at the 25th percentile (`kfr pooled_p25`) in your home Census tract compare to mean (population-weighted, using `count_pooled`) upward mobility in your state and in the U.S. overall?  Do kids where you grew up have better or worse chances of climbing the income ladder than the average child in America?

**Hint**: The Opportunity Atlas website will give you the tract, county, and state FIPS codes for your home address. For example, searching for “Lynwood Road, Verona, New Jersey” will display Tract 34013021000, Verona, NJ.  The first two digits refer to the state code, the next three digits refer to the county code, and the last 6 digits refer to the tract code.  In R, you can list these observations with the function `filter()` as follows (assuming you called the data as atlas as in Table 2). If you only want to see `kfr_pooled_p25`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
atlas_lynwood<-atlas%>%
  filter(state == 34 & county == 013 & tract == 021000)

atlas_lynwood%>%
  select(kfr_pooled_p25)
```

Or to see all the variables for that tract:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
View(atlas_lynwood)
```

See the [Cheat-sheet Section](#cheatsheetproject1) below for further help.

4.	What is the standard deviation of upward mobility (population-weighted) in your home county? Is it larger or smaller than the standard deviation across tracts in your state? Across tracts in the country? What do you learn from these comparisons?

5.	Now let’s turn to downward mobility: repeat questions (3) and (4) looking at children who start with parents at the 75th and 100th percentiles.  How do the patterns differ?

6.	Using a linear regression, estimate the relationship between outcomes of children at the 25th and 75th percentile for the Census tracts in your home county.  Generate a scatter plot to visualize this regression.  Do areas where children from low-income families do well generally have better outcomes for those from high-income families, too?

7.	Next, examine whether the patterns you have looked at above are similar by race. If there is not enough racial heterogeneity in the area of interest (i.e., data is missing for most racial groups), then choose a different area to examine.

8.	Using the Census tracts in your home county, can you identify any covariates which help explain some of the patterns you have identified above? Some examples of covariates you might examine include housing prices, income inequality, fraction of children with single parents, job density, etc. For 2 or 3 of these, report estimated correlation coefficients along with their 95% confidence intervals.  

9.	Open question: formulate a hypothesis for why you see the variation in upward mobility for children who grew up in the Census tracts near your home and provide correlational evidence testing that hypothesis.  

For this question, many covariates have been provided to you in the `atlas.rds` file, which are described in the Table under the [Data Description section](#description).  

10.	Putting together all the analyses you did above, what have you learned about the determinants of economic opportunity where you grew up?  Identify one or two key lessons or takeaways that you might discuss with a policymaker or journalist if asked about your hometown. Mention any important caveats to your conclusions; for example, can we conclude that the variable you identified as a key predictor in the question above has a causal effect (i.e., changing it would change upward mobility) based on that analysis? Why or why not?

## Cheatsheat commands  {- #cheatsheetproject1}

**R command	Description**

Here I present a summary of the commands you could use to work on this project. There are two important issues you should keep in mind while reading this: 

1. Notice that whenever you see `yvar` this is **not a real variable**. It is only a place holder for the appropriate variable that you decide to analyze or use. For example, if you want to see the mean across neighborhoods of the average household income as measured in 2000, you would not do `mean(atlas$yvar, na.rm=TRUE)` but `mean(atlas$hhinc_mean2000, na.rm=TRUE)`.

:::: {.blackbox data-latex=""}
::: {.center data-latex=""}
**Important!**
:::

**'yvar'** is not a real variable. You should replace it for the appropriate variable in your code.
::::

2. The data `atlas` has missing information for _some_ neighborhoods for _some_ variables. These are called `NA` or missing. Most R functions do not like that you include missings in the function, because R does not know what to do with that. What is `5+NA` ? NA !! So, for many of these functions, we will **explicitely tell R to ignore NAs**. That is what the option `na.rm=TRUE` does. It does not not exist for every function, but it does for most of the ones we will use here. 

:::: {.blackbox data-latex=""}
::: {.center data-latex=""}
**Important!**
:::

Careful with missing values (also called **'NA'**)! We will use *'na.rm=TRUE'* as an option for several functions to tell R to ignore the missings. 
::::

### Unweighted summary statistics {-}

```{r, eval=FALSE}
summary(atlas$yvar)
mean(atlas$yvar, na.rm=TRUE)
sd(atlas$yvar, na.rm=TRUE)
```

###  Load package {-}

If you wanted to install and open the package `Hmisc` (which you will need to calculate the weighted statistics), run:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("Hmisc")
library(Hmisc)
```

### Weighted summary statistics {-}

You can weight means or other statistics. In our case, we want to use the **population weighted** statistics in several cases. That is, we want to put more weight on the value of a tract in which more people live than in another with lower population. Recall that the population variable is `count_pooled`.

1. Weighted mean: 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
wtd.mean(atlas$yvar, atlas$count_pooled)
```

2. Weighted standard deviation:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
sqrt(wtd.var(atlas$yvar, atlas$count_pooled))
```

### Subset observations {-}

1. State level:

If you want to select a subset of observations, you can add the rule for selecting those observations, and the `filter` function. Here we subset the observations for the State of Wisconsin, and called the resulting dataset `atlas_wisconsin`.

```{r}
atlas_wisconsin <- atlas %>% 
  filter(state == 55)
```

2. County level:

We can do the same but now for a specific county, adding an extra rule after a comma `,` or `&`. Here we subset the observations for Milwaukee County in Wisconsin:

```{r}
atlas_milwaukee <- atlas %>% 
  filter(state == 55 & county == 079) 
```

### Standardize variables {-}

You can standardize variables by substracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. Let us say that you want to standardize only considering the variables in Milwaukee, then you can do this: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
atlas_milwaukee<- atlas_milwaukee %>%
  mutate(x_std=(xvar - mean(atlas_milwaukee$xvar, na.rm=TRUE))/sd(atlas_milwaukee$xvar, na.rm=TRUE))
```

As an example, let's say you want to standardize both the measure of mobility and the annual job growth for the data in Wisconsin:


```{r}
atlas_wisconsin<- atlas_wisconsin %>%
  mutate(kfr_pooled_p25_std=(kfr_pooled_p25 - mean(atlas_wisconsin$kfr_pooled_p25, na.rm=TRUE))/sd(atlas_wisconsin$kfr_pooled_p25, na.rm=TRUE),
         ann_avg_job_growth_2004_2013_std=(ann_avg_job_growth_2004_2013 - mean(atlas_wisconsin$ann_avg_job_growth_2004_2013, na.rm=TRUE))/sd(atlas_wisconsin$ann_avg_job_growth_2004_2013, na.rm=TRUE))
```

### Run regression {-}

I have written a whole section explaining regression in more detail: Section \@ref(regression). Please see that for further details. But here is a quick help.

1. Simple linear regression

Let's say you want to run a simple regression of variable `yvar` on variable `xvar1` for the county of Milwaukee. We will save the results of that regression in an object call `mod1` (we could give it any name). Then you would do this:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
mod1 <- lm(yvar~xvar1, data = atlas_milwaukee)
```

To see what the outcome of the regression is, you would use the function `summary` and apply it to our new object `mod1`, like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
summary(mod1)
```

As an example, we could regress the mobility of children from parents in the 25th percentile (`kfr_pooled_p25`) on the average annual job growth rate between 2004 and 2013 (`ann_avg_job_growth_2004_2013`). To do that, we would run: 

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
mod1 <- lm(kfr_pooled_p25~ann_avg_job_growth_2004_2013, data = atlas_milwaukee)
```

2. Multivariate linear regression

You might want to understand the relationship between `yvar` and variable `xvar1` **while holding fixed** another variable `xvar2` for neighborhoods only in Milwaukee. You can do this: 

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
mod2 <- lm(yvar~xvar1+xvar2 + xvar3, data = atlas_milwaukee)
```

### How to read the regression output? {-}

To simplify the interpretation, let's run a regression where you use the standardize both the measure of mobility and the annual job growth for the data in Wisconsin: 

``` {r}
mod3 <- lm(kfr_pooled_p25_std ~ ann_avg_job_growth_2004_2013_std, data = atlas_wisconsin)
summary(mod3)
```

You should focus here on interpreting the coefficient for `ann_avg_job_growth_2004_2013_std`. You should pay attention to both the magnitude of the number, and the sign. In this case, you would read it like this: 

> In **Wisconsin**, increasing **one standard deviation** the average annual job growth rate **is correlated** with an **reduction** of **0.05 standard deviations** in the economic mobility for children with parents in the 25th percertile.


### Plotting the linear relationship  {-}


You need to load the `ggplot2` package (which should be installed already). 

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

Suppose you want to visually see the linear relationship between two variables in the `atlas_milwaukee` dataset that we filtered above. Then, you can do this: 

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = atlas_milwaukee) + geom_point(aes(x = xvar1, y = yvar)) + 
  geom_smooth(aes(x = xvar1, y = yvar), method = "lm", se = F)
```

The function `geom_smooth()` adds the line that you calculated above for `mod1`, where you ran `mod1 <- lm(yvar~xvar1, data = atlas_milwaukee)`.

For more, see Section \@ref(viz).
