- Correlation of Mobility and Education
- How to measure how much mobility each college provides

# Education 

## Education and Upward Mobility

- Education is widely viewed as one of the most scalable pathways to upward mobility

- But there is growing concern that education no longer provides a strong pathway to opportunity in the U.S.

    - U.S. students perform worse on standardized tests on average than in many European countries despite higher spending on schools

    - Sharp differences in quality of schools across districts

    - Rising costs of college  lack of access for low-income students

    - Concern that some colleges (e.g., for-profit institutions) may not produce good outcomes

## Education and Upward mobility

- How can we improve education in America? 

    - Traditionally, measuring impacts of education systematically was difficult

    - Administrative data from colleges and school districts are giving us a more scientific understanding of the “education production function”

- Start with higher education, then turn to K-12 education

## How Do Colleges Shape Income Mobility in the U.S.?

- How does the higher education system affect intergenerational income mobility in the U.S.?

    - In principle, higher education can provide a pathway to upward mobility that is not directly shaped by the neighborhood where a child happens to grow up

    - But if children from higher-income families tend to attend  better colleges, higher education system may not promote mobility

    - Colleges could actually increase intergenerational persistence of income if disparities in college attendance are sufficiently large

## Effect of Higher Education System on Mobility

- Effect of higher education system on mobility depends upon three factors:

    - [Inputs] Parental income distributions by college

    - [Outputs] Students’ earnings outcomes conditional on parental income by college

    - [Causal share] Portion of variation in students’ earnings outcomes that is due to colleges’ causal effects

## Estimating the Three Parameters: Data

- Chetty et al. (2017) estimate these three parameters using data covering all college students in the U.S. from 1999-2013 (30 million students) 

- Combine information from three sources to construct an anonymized dataset:

    - Parental and Student Income from income tax records

    - College attendance from 1098-T tax data and Pell grant data

    - SAT scores from College Board

>Note: all statistics are based on college attendance (not completion)

# Parents’ Income Distributions by College: Income Segregation in the American Higher Education System

## Measuring Parents’ Incomes

- Parent income: average pre-tax household income during five year period when child is aged 15-19 


- Focus on percentile ranks, ranking parents relative to other parents with children in same birth cohort

## Parental Income Segregation Across Colleges

- Sharp differences in parental income distributions across colleges  there is significant segregation across colleges

- Useful benchmark to quantify magnitude: compare to degree of segregation across neighborhoods

- Common perception: colleges foster greater interaction between children from different socioeconomic backgrounds than places in which they grew up

## Parental Income Distribution of Peers of Children from Bottom Quintile

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}

```

## Trends in Income Segregation

- Preceding estimates are based on children born between 1980-82, who attended college in the early 2000s

- Substantial changes in higher education system since that time, e.g. substantial changes in financial aid and tuition policies

- How has income segregation across colleges changed in recent years?

# Outcomes: Students’ Earnings Distributions

## Students’ Earnings Outcomes

- Measure children’s individual earnings in their mid-30s

- Define percentile ranks by ranking children relative to others in same birth cohort

## Distribution of Children’s Individual Labor Earnings at Age 34

1980 Cohort

## Students’ Earnings Outcomes: Columbia vs. SUNY-Stony Brook

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec5_mob_ed/columbia_suny.png")
```

## Students’ Earnings Outcomes

- Key lesson: most of the gap in outcomes between children from low vs. high-income families is explained by differences between rather than within colleges

- Raises possibility that reallocating student across colleges could potentially have a significant impact on intergenerational mobility

    - If gap in outcomes by parental income were large even within a given college, there would be little scope to have an impact through changes in college admissions policies


## Differences in Mobility Rates Across Colleges

- We can combine data on parents’ incomes and students’ outcomes to characterize colleges’ mobility rates

    - At which colleges in America do the largest number of children come from poor families and end up in the upper middle class?

```

## Measuring Mobility Rates

Define a college’s mobility rate (MR) as the fraction of its students who come from bottom quintile and end up in top quintile

Mobility rate is: 

\begin{align*}
\underbrace{\text{Mobility Rate}}_{\text{Frac. of Parents in Q1 and Children in Q5}}= & \underbrace{\text{Low-Inc. Access}}_{\text{Frac. of Parents in Q1}} \times \\
& \underbrace{\text{Top-Quintile Rate}}_{\text{Frac. of Students who Reach Q5 Given Parents in Q1}}
\end{align*}

At SUNY:     
	
$$
8.4\%	=      	     16\%       	\times        	  51\%
$$
