1. Geographical Variation in Upward Mobility in America

2. Causal Effects of Places vs. Sorting

Lecture based primarily on the following paper:

>Chetty, Friedman, Hendren, Jones, Porter. “The Opportunity Atlas: Mapping the Childhood Roots of Social Mobility” NBER WP, 2018

# Geographical Variation in Upward Mobility

## Differences in Opportunity Across Local Areas

- How do children’s chances of moving up vary across areas in America?

    - Are there some areas where kids do better than others?  If so, what lessons can we learn from them?

- Recent studies have used big data to measure how upward mobility varies based on where children grow up

## The Opportunity Atlas: Data Sources and Sample Definitions

- Data sources: Anonymized Census data (2000, 2010, ACS) covering U.S. population linked to federal income tax returns from 1989-2015

- Link children to parents based on dependent claiming on tax returns

- Target sample: Children in 1978-83 birth cohorts who were born in the U.S. or are authorized immigrants who came to the U.S. in childhood

- Analysis sample: 20.5 million children, 96% coverage rate of target sample


## Measuring Parents’ and Children’s Incomes in Tax Data

- Parents’ household incomes: average income reported on Form 1040 tax return from 1994-2000

- Children’s incomes measured from tax returns in 2014-15 (ages 31-37)

- Focus on percentile ranks in national distribution:

- Rank children relative to others born in the same year and parents relative to other parents


## Intergenerational Income Mobility for Children Raised in Chicago

```{r fig_mob_chicago, fig.cap="Source: Chetty, Hendren, Kline, Saez 2014", echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/mob_chicago.png")
```

## Intergen. Mobility for Children Raised in Hypothetical Census Tract

```{r fig_mob_hyptract, fig.cap="Source: Chetty, Hendren, Kline, Saez 2014", echo=FALSE, out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/mob_hyptract.png")
```

## Estimating Children’s Average Outcomes by Census Tract

- Run a separate regression using data for children who grow up in each Census tract in America

- In practice, many children move across areas in childhood

- Weight children by fraction of childhood (up to age 23) spent in a given area


## The Geography of Upward Mobility in the United States

```{r mobCZ, fig.cap="Source: Chetty, Friedman, Hendren, Jones and Porter (2018)", echo=FALSE, out.width = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/mobility_CZ_chetty18.png")
```
