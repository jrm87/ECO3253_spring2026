## Trends in Mobility Over Time

- Thus far, we have focused primarily on a snapshot of rates of upward mobility for children growing up in America today

- As we just discussed, a historical perspective is often useful in understanding determinants of current outcomes

- We cannot yet study trends in mobility by neighborhood, but we have made progress in understanding mobility over time at the national level


## A Historical Perspective on the American Dream

- Historically, American Dream has been defined as the aspiration that children should have higher standards of living than their parents

- When asked to assess economic progress, children frequently compare their earnings to their parents [Goldthorpe 1987]

- Obama (2014): “People’s frustrations are partly rooted “in the fear that their kids won’t be better off than they were”

- What fraction of children earn more than their parents, and how has this changed over time?

## Data issues 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec4_hist_mob/lec4_halikiasreeves16.png")
```

## Measuring the American Dream

- Key challenge: don’t have data linking parents to kids historically

- Chetty et al. (Science, 2017) develop a method of estimating historical rates of mobility even in the absence of parent-child links

- First describe basic results and then explain methodology

```


## Methodology: Constructing Historical Estimates of Mobility
 
- Researchers are able to get reliable estimates of mobility even though we do not have historical data linking kids to parents

- Fundamental reason: almost all kids born in 1940 earned more than all parents  does not matter which kids are born to which parents

## Household Income Distributions of Parents and Children at Age 30 (Children in 1940 Birth Cohort)

## Methodology: Constructing Historical Estimates of Mobility

- We are able to get reliable estimates of mobility even though we do not have historical data linking kids to parents

- Fundamental reason: almost **all** kids born in 1940 earned more than **all** parents $\rightarrow$ does not matter which kids are born to which parents

- This is **not** the case for kids born in 1980s, but fortunately we have data linking kids to parents for that generation

## What Policies Can Increase Absolute Mobility?

- Two major changes in American economy since 1940: lower total economic growth rates and less equal distribution of growth

## Growth in Real Mean Family Income by Income Quintile

1947-1973

## Growth in Real Mean Family Income by Income Quintile 

1947-1973 vs. 1973-2013
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}

```

## Income growth by percentile

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}

```

## Share of Income Going to Households in the Top 1%, by Year

```

## What Policies Can Revive Absolute Mobility?

- Two major changes in American economy since 1940: lower total economic growth rates and less equal distribution of growth

- Consider two hypothetical scenarios for children born in 1980:

    1. Higher growth: growth rate since birth corresponding to 1940 cohort, with income distributed as it is today

    2. More broadly shared growth: Same growth rates as today, but distributed across income groups as in 1940 cohort

# International comparison of intergenerational mobility

## Trends in Upward Mobility: International Comparisons

- Recap of last lecture: fraction of children earning more than their parents fell from 90% for those born in 1940 to 50% for those born in 1980

- Two-thirds of this decline was due to changes in the distribution of growth and one-third was due to slowing overall growth rate of American economy

- How does the American experience compare to other countries?

- Berman (2018) applies methodology of Chetty et al. (Science, 2017) in other countries to answer this question

## Mobility in the US

## Restoring the American Dream
 
- Main lesson: restoring the American Dream of high rates of upward mobility will require more broadly shared economic growth

- Need policies that will increase incomes in the bottom and middle of the income distribution


## Restoring the American Dream: Two approaches
 
- Two broad approaches: redistribution (taxes/transfers, min wages) or increasing skills of lower-income Americans (“human capital”)

    1. Piketty and Saez: reductions in top income taxes and erosion of unions and minimum wages have led working-class Americans to fall behind 

    2. Goldin and Katz: race between education and technology – need education to keep pace with technological change to increase wage rates


## What is education?

- We will discuss both tax policy and education in greater detail in later lectures

- Important note: “education” is not just about technical skills

- Deming (2018) demonstrates this by investigating how wage rates vary with technical and social skills over time

## What is education?

- We will discuss both tax policy and education in greater detail in later lectures

- Important note: “education” is not just about technical skills

- Deming (2018) demonstrates this by investigating how wage rates vary with technical and social skills over time

- Policies to improve such skills could range from changes in education and training programs to housing voucher policies

## Is Increasing Social Mobility Desirable?

- Thus far we have assumed that our goal should be to increase mobility

- But policies that increase mobility may not be desirable from an efficiency perspective

- Random college admissions would maximize social mobility

- But would violate principle of meritocracy and would likely reduce total economic output and growth

- Next large topic: Human capital accumulation (role of education)
