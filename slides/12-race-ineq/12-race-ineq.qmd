```

## An Intergenerational Perspective on Racial Disparities

- Most prior work has studied racial disparities within a single generation

- We will take an intergenerational perspective, focusing on dynamics of income across generations

- Intergenerational approach sheds light on which disparities will persist in the long run and allows us to isolate the factors that drive persistent gaps

    - Methods: dynamics of income and steady states

## Intergenerational Persistence of Racial Disparities

- Black Americans are close to their long-run steady-state 

    - Suggests that intergenerational gaps (not transitory factors) drive most of the black-white gap today

- Addressing the black-white gap therefore requires understanding sources of intergenerational gaps

    - Why do black children earn less than white children who grow up in families with comparable incomes?

## Gender Differences in Racial Gaps

- First step in understanding this: examine differences by gender

- Focus on individual (own) income for this analysis, excluding spousal income

## Explaining the Black-White Intergenerational Income Gap

Family-Level Factors:

- Do family-level factors (e.g., parental wealth, education, etc.) explain the black-white intergenerational gap?

    - No: Black men who grow up in two-parent families with comparable income, education, and wealth to white men still fare worse

- Suggests that environmental factors beyond the family matter

- Study the role of environmental factors by analyzing differences in black-white gaps across neighborhoods

## Neighborhood Environments and the Black-White Gap

- Commuting-zone level variation illuminates broad regional patterns but does not directly test for “neighborhood” effects

- Blacks live in different neighborhoods from whites within CZs

- Zoom in to examine variation across Census tracts

## Variation in the Black-White Earnings Gap Across Tracts

Four key results:

1. Black boys have lower earnings than white boys in 99% of Census tracts in America, controlling for parental income

## Variation in the Black-White Earnings Gap Across Tracts

Four key results:

1. Black boys have lower earnings than white boys in 99% of Census tracts in America, controlling for parental income

2. Both black and white boys have better outcomes in “good” (e.g., low-poverty, higher rent) neighborhoods, but the black-white gap is bigger in such areas

## Correlations between Tract-Level Characteristics and Incomes of Black vs. White Men

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '70%'}

## Black – White Gap in Individual Income Ranks vs. Share Above Poverty Line

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec9_race_ineq/pov_w_b_gap.png")
```

## Variation in the Black-White Earnings Gap Across Tracts

Four key results:

1. Black boys have lower earnings than white boys in 99% of Census tracts in America, controlling for parental income

2. Both black and white boys have better outcomes in “good” (e.g., low-poverty, higher rent) neighborhoods, but the black-white gap is bigger in such areas

3. Within low-poverty areas, there are two factors associated with better outcomes for black boys and smaller gaps: greater father presence and less racial bias

## Black-White Gap in Employment Rates vs. Father Presence

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec9_race_ineq/pov_w_b_gap2.png")
```

## Male-Female Gap in Employment Rates vs. Father Presence

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '90%'}

```

## Variation in the Black-White Earnings Gap Across Tracts

2. Both black and white boys have better outcomes in “good” (e.g., low-poverty, higher rent) neighborhoods, but the black-white gap is bigger in such areas

3. Within low-poverty areas, there are two factors associated with better outcomes for black boys and smaller gaps: greater father presence and less racial bias

4. Neighborhoods have causal childhood exposure effects on racial gaps: black boys who move to good areas at a younger age do better

## Summary: Impacts of Neighborhood Environments on Black Men

- Black boys do well in nbhds. with good resources (low poverty rates) and good race-specific factors (e.g., high father presence, less racial bias)

- The problem is that there very few such neighborhoods in America…

# Racial Wealth Gap

## Racial Wealth Gap in the US

- So far we have ignored the role of wealth. 

- (Very!) recent work has started to make important progress in estimating wealth gaps as well (beyond income)

> Ellora Derenoncourt, Chi Hyun Kim, Moritz Kuhn, Moritz Schularick (2022) "Wealth of two nations: The U.S. racial wealth gap, 1860-2020"

## wealth gap, 1860-2020

- Data: 
    - Historical census data
    - Early state tax records
    - Historical waves of the Survey of Consumer Finance
    
- Several things could affect wealth accumulation across race groups: 

    - Initial conditions (initial wealth)
    - Income growth
    - Savings behavior
    - Capital returns
    - What's the role of each?

```

## Conclusions about the wealth gap

- The shape of convergence is well explained by initial wealth and income levels of Black and white Americans and observed income convergence between the two groups. 
- Given extremely low levels of Black wealth under slavery, even modest accumulation can imply a high growth rate for Black wealth that greatly exceeds that of white wealth, thus generating rapid convergence initially
- As racial wealth gap decreases, convergence slows and differences in returns on wealth and savings begin to matter more for the shape of convergence. 
- Rising asset prices have become important driver of racial wealth inequality in recent decades. 

    - Average white household holds a significant share of their wealth in equity (benefited from booming stock prices), while the average Black household mainly holds housing as main asset been largely left out of these gains
