## Tax Policy: Overview

- Focus in these lectures on two aspects of tax policy to illustrate broader concepts:

    - Income taxation

    - Taxation of savings

- Methods:

    - Supply and demand models

    - Synthetic control

    - Behavioral economics

## Income Taxation

- Most developed countries have progressive income tax systems

    - Tax rates rise with income, so rich pay a larger proportion of their incomes in taxes than the poor

    - Typically implemented with a set of separate tax brackets based on income

## Marginal Income Tax Rates vs. Average Tax Rates: Illustrative Example

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec16_tax1/mg_av_tax.png")
```


## Top Income Tax Rates

- Particular focus on marginal tax rates on highest income earners (“top income tax rate”)

    - Generates significant revenue given concentration of income at the top of the distribution

- Top income tax rates are heavily debated and have fluctuated significantly over time in the U.S.

## Top Marginal Income Tax Rates in the U.S. Over the Past 100 Years

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec16_tax1/tax_highest.png")
```


## Economic Approach to Optimal Taxation

- Choice of tax rates is often viewed as a purely political issue

- Economic approach: set tax rates based on tradeoff between equity vs. efficiency

- Equity: Additional $1 of income is worth more in terms of utility (well-being) to a family earning $10,000 per year than a family earning $250,000 per year

    - This force pushes towards higher tax rates on high-income earners

- Efficiency: higher tax rates on the rich  less incentive for them to work  less economic innovation, growth, etc.

    - This force pushes towards lower tax rates on high-income earners

## Economic Approach to Optimal Taxation

- Optimal tax system balances gain from equity with efficiency cost

- Gains from equity rely on value judgements: how much more is money worth to low-income households than high-income households?

    - Economists typically leave these judgements to the public/political process

- Efficiency impacts depend upon how much rates of work are affected by changes in tax rates

    - Large literature on estimating elasticity of labor supply with respect to tax rate using modern tax data

## Labor Supply Curve

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec16_tax1/l_supply.png")
```


## Elasticity of Labor Supply

- Elasticity: % change in quantity when price changes by 1%

- Widely used measure because elasticities are unit free

- Elasticity of hours with respect to wages measures percentage change in hours worked in response to a 1% change in wage:

$$\epsilon_{l,w}=\frac{\Delta l / l}{\Delta w / w}$$

## Labor Supply Elasticities

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec16_tax1/l_supply_types.png")
```


## Revenue-Maximizing Tax Rate: The Laffer Curve

- Consider extreme scenario where we place zero social value on additional income for individuals in top 1%

- Even in this case, optimal tax rate in top bracket is not 100%

- Why? Laffer Curve

## The Laffer Curve

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec16_tax1/laffer_curve.png")
```


## The Laffer Curve

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec16_tax1/laffer_curve2.png")
```


## Revenue-Maximizing Tax Rate

- With a flat (constant) tax at rate 𝑡, tax revenue is $𝑅(𝑡)=𝑡×𝑤×𝐿(𝑡)$

- $𝑅 (𝑡 = 0) = 0$ because $𝑡 = 0$; $𝑅(𝑡 = 100\%)= 0$ because $𝐿(𝑡=100\% )= 0$

- Rate at which tax revenue is maximized is: 

$$t_{max}=\frac{1}{(1+\epsilon_{l,w})}$$

- Examples:

    - Elasticity = 0 $\rightarrow$ revenue-maximizing tax rate is 100%

    - Elasticity = 0.25 $\rightarrow$ revenue-maximizing tax rate is 80%

    - Elasticity = 1 $\rightarrow$ revenue-maximizing tax rate is 50%

## The Laffer Curve and “Supply Side Economics”

- Arthur Laffer argued that we were on the wrong side of the Laffer curve in the 1980s

    - Argued that cutting taxes would both increase tax revenue and stimulate economic growth

- Motivated large top income tax cuts enacted by Reagan

- Is this argument correct empirically? 

## Estimating Labor Supply Elasticities

- Several modern studies use difference-in-difference methods to estimate effects of taxation on how much people work

- Typical approach: analyze impacts of a change in tax rates for one group (e.g., top income earners) 

    - Use other income groups as a control

## Marginal Tax Rates on Labor Income in Denmark, 1984-2005

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec16_tax1/kleven_schultz1.png")
```


## Difference-in-Differences Quasi-Experimental Methodology

- Exploit differential changes in pollution across counties to implement a differences-in-differences quasi-experimental research design

- Idea of diff-in-diff: approximate experiment by comparing an area that experienced a change (“treatment”) with an area that did not (“control”)

- Compare differences in outcomes in treatment area vs. control area, before vs. after policy change

## Effects of the 1987 Danish Tax Cut on Taxable Labor Income

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec16_tax1/kleven_schultz2.png")
```


## Estimating Effects of Income Tax Changes

- Another approach: use state-level tax variation as a natural experiment

- In 2012, Kansas enacted sharp tax cuts on top incomes

    - Top income tax rates reduced from 6.45% to 4.9%

    - Business income taxes reduced sharply to zero on some forms of income

- Governor Sam Brownback: plan would deliver a “shot of adrenaline” to Kansas economy and tax cuts would pay for themselves

    - Is this what happened?  Recent studies evaluate this using tax data

```


## Synthetic Control

- No one state is a perfect control for Kansas by itself

- But we can form a “synthetic” Kansas by constructing a composite average of other states that mirror its trends prior to the reform

- Synthetic control: form a control group by choosing a set of weights on other observations to match treated group [Abadie et al. 2010]

- Commonly used to construct a control group in difference-in-differences designs

## Effects of Taxation on Labor Supply: Summary

- Literature generally suggests that elasticity of labor income with respect to wage rates is modest, around 0.3

- If one places much less social value on incomes of top earners than lower income families, suggests that optimal tax rates are high

```


## Is the “Optimal” Top Income Tax Rate 70%?

- Impacts of tax rates on labor supply are sufficiently small (elasticity = 0.3) that revenue-maximizing top income tax rate may be as high at 70%

- Does this mean that the “correct” tax rate on high income families is 70%?

- Not necessarily, for two reasons:

    - Revenue-maximizing calculation puts zero weight on the marginal value of income for high-income families

    - Not clear that the average American places a very high value on equity of incomes
    
## Measuring Public Preferences for Redistribution

- Kuziemko et al. (2015) measure preferences for redistribution using online surveys of about 4,000 Americans  

    - Conducted online using Amazon’s mTurk platform

- Asked people about their preferred tax rate for the top 1%

- Then evaluated impacts of providing information about inequality on preferences for redistribution using a randomized experiment

- 2,000 people randomly selected to receive information about trends in inequality and effects of taxes on economic growth

```

## Income Taxation: Summary

- Recall that economic framework to evaluate tax policy weighs benefits of greater equity from higher tax rates on the rich against efficiency costs

- Modern empirical evidence shows that efficiency costs of taxes are modest

    - Taxes on the top 1% can be increased from current levels without a risk of dramatic reductions in economic activity

- But whether this means we should have high top income tax rates depends upon value judgements about the importance of equity

    - There may be broader public support, especially in the U.S., for equality of opportunity, than equality of outcomes (earnings)
